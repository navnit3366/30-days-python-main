# Day 1 - Hangman Game :zero::one:

In the first day, we're going to build a simple hangman game.

## Step-by-step (simplified) :ledger:

1. Create a list of words that will be throughout the game
2. Create a function to pick a random word from the list
3. Create a function to get the answer from the user
4. Create a function to print the "interface"
5. Create the logic for winning and losing the game

## Additional Steps I Took (might not be the most effective and efficient way) :walking:

1. Create a txt file to store the list of words that are going to be used. Used ChatGPT to produce the list for this program (*see ./screenshot/*)
2. Create a python file to store the custom message and Hangman ASCII art. 
3. Creating docstrings for every function

## Further Improvements (might apply these in the future) :chart_with_upwards_trend:

1. Feature that allows user to choose the category of words by integrating external API or simply manually add other options to be choosed from
