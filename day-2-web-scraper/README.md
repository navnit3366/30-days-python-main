# Day 2 - Web Scraper 0️⃣2️⃣

In the second day, we're going to follow along a tutorial from Real Python on [how to build a simple web scraper using Beautiful Soup](https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/).  
In addition, we're going to write the result to a CSV file too!

## Step-by-step (simplified) 📒

1. Send GET request to the website we want to scrape
2. Look at the page HTML structure and find which id/class we want to watch
3. Use Beautiful Soup to extract the information
4. Create a 2D list to contain the extracted informations
5. Write to CSV

## Additional Step(s) I Took (might not be the most effective and efficient way) 🚶:

1. Creating functions (in hopes of making it simpler, which I think don't work out 😵‍💫)

## Further Improvement(s) (might apply these in the future) 📈:

1. Scrape "real" websites!
